# Particle-Starter
Starter Project for some Particle Physics Research



zen - The Zen of Python, since everyone using Python should use it. (Also I used it to test some file reading)

functions - Just me testing some algorithms

regexSandBox - The less said, the better

muons.txt - file containing particle data

runner - program that reads data from muons.txt and calculates corresponding four-vectors along with invariant mass
